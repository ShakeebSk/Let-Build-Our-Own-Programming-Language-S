# 🧠 Let’s Build Our Own Programming Language — S#

> **S#** is a minimal, interpreted programming language built from scratch using **Python**, created for deep understanding of how programming languages work internally.

This project is **educational-first** and focuses on the **core principles of language design**, including lexical analysis, parsing, abstract syntax trees, and interpretation.

## 📌 Why This Project?

Modern programming languages feel like magic — but they are not.

This project exists to answer questions like:
- How does source code turn into executable behavior?
- How does a compiler/interpreter understand syntax?
- What actually happens when a program runs?
- How are errors detected and reported?

By building **S#**, we learn **how programs are programmed to program programs**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a programming language **from first principles**
- Understand the full pipeline:
  - Lexer → Parser → AST → Interpreter
- Avoid black-box tools
- Write every component manually
- Keep the design simple, clean, and extensible

## 🚀 What Is S#?

**S#** is:
- Interpreted
- Dynamically typed
- Minimal by design
- Statement-based
- Built incrementally

Example S# code:

```s#
let x = 10
let y = x * 2
PRINT(y)
